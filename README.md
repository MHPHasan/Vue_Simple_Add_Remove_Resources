## Running my Code

If you want to run my code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Run npm install in the project folder to install all required dependencies => This
    will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise.
2. Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:
    (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
