# Using the Code Attachments

These code attachments serve two main purposes:

```
You can compare your code to mine to find + fix errors in your code
You can run my code to see what we build / how it should behave
```
## Running my Code

If you want to run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This
    will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise ( _it's not in the attachment_
    _because that would bloat the ZIP file_ )
2. Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:
    (or whichever port is shown in your terminal)
